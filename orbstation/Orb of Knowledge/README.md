This is the Orb of Knowledge~! Or, in less tongue-in-cheek words, It's where Orbstation's lore will be stored, as people come up with it, in order to put it somewhere on the repository, so people can look at it and read it without needing to worry about hunting through the discord.

#What this Isn't

*This is not an authoritative source for lore. This is both a living document and also not intended to make someone wrong for how they are writing their characters.
*This is not a granular place to store anything that happens round to round. This should not name anyone's characters or direct relations, and should keep to big picture discussions.
*This is not set in stone. Don't put anything into the Lore documentation that you're fully uncomfortable with someone else touching up. By the same extension, however, don't undo someone's work without discussing it. Cooperation is key to ensuring people have a good time!
*This is not that serious! Have fun with it. We're all here to write a bunch of characters living in a galactic late-capitalist cyberpunk dystopia, with the average round swinging from drama to horror to black comedy and slice of life.

With all that out of the way, let's have some fun writing lore!
